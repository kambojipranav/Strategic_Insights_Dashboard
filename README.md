🌍 Overview

The Strategic Intelligence Dashboard is designed as a centralized hub for business analysts, strategy teams, and data scientists to monitor and visualize market trends, competitor performance, and intelligence alerts.

By combining data visualization (using Matplotlib and Seaborn) with interactive dashboard interfaces, this project enables users to quickly grasp large-scale data insights and make informed decisions.

The system is modular, extendable, and deployable — suitable for organizations that want to track strategic information from multiple data feeds.

🎯 Objectives

Deploy a unified interface for tracking competitor trajectories, trend evolution, and strategic alerts.

Present data-driven insights through interactive visualizations and customizable filters.

Provide configurable dashboards for different focus areas like sector, time period, and competitor selection.

Enable decision-makers to explore analytics and download summaries for offline review.

🚀 Features

Interactive Dashboard: Seamlessly filter by sector, time range, and competitor list.

Trend Analysis: Observe growth patterns and benchmark progression using line and area charts.

Competitor Benchmarking: Compare multiple entities across metrics such as revenue, innovation, or engagement.

Alert System: Visualize performance anomalies, growth spikes, or sudden declines.

Historical Tracking: Display timelines of key events and intelligence updates.

Customizable Views: Switch between summary, historical, and comparative layouts.

Data Export: Download current filtered results in CSV or PNG format.

🏗 Architecture

The dashboard architecture is modular and scalable.

3️⃣ Visualization Module

Generates charts and graphics using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights like:

Time-based trends

Sector-wise comparisons

Heatmaps

Alert frequency graphs

4️⃣ Dashboard Interface

Provides an interactive UI layer where users can:

Filter by sector, time range, and competitor

Customize chart types

View real-time analytics

Export visual summaries

🔄 Data Flow
Data Source → Preprocessing → Analytics Engine → Visualization → Dashboard UI


Input: Raw data from multiple sources

Processing: Cleaning, normalization, and metric computation

Output: Interactive visualizations for trend and competitor tracking

⚙️ Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.9 or later

pip (Python package manager)

Git

Steps

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/strategic-intelligence-dashboard.git
cd strategic-intelligence-dashboard


Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py


For Dash version:

python app.py


Open in Browser:

http://localhost:8501/

🧩 Usage

Launch the dashboard locally.

Upload or load data from default datasets.

Use the sidebar filters to narrow by sector, date, and competitors.

View generated charts, timelines, and alerts in real-time.

Export visuals or reports using “Download” button.

📊 Dashboard Features
Section	Functionality
